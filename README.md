# juxtaPosition
NSS Front-end capstone project

## Problem
It's Sunday morning. The games are about to start. You *need* to win this head-to-head matchup against your co-worker, so you can be granted an entire week's worth of bragging rights. It comes down to this one decision... do you start Wide Receiver A or Wide Receiver B? Running Back C or Running Back D? Tight End X or Tight End Y?

Enter juxtaPosition.

##Solution
Simply start typing the names of the two players in question. juxta will immediately populate the page with a full side-by-side layout of all the info, stats, and expert projections you need to make a supremely informed decision and lay waste to all other teams in your Fantasy Football league.
