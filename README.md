# JuxtaPosition
A side-by-side player comparison tool for fantasy football enthusiasts.

m-tambo.github.io/juxta-position

## Problem
It's Sunday morning. The games are about to start. You *need* to win this head-to-head matchup against your friend/co-worker/annoying roommate, so you can be granted an entire week's worth of bragging rights. It comes down to this one decision... do you start Wide Receiver A or Wide Receiver B? Running Back 1 or Running Back 2? Tight End X or Tight End Y?

Enter JuxtaPosition.

## Solution
Simply start typing the names of the two players in question. Juxta will immediately populate the page with a full side-by-side layout of all the info, stats, and expert projections you need to make a supremely informed decision and lay waste to all other teams in your Fantasy Football league.


#### Landing Page
Enter two players and the week of the matchup. </br>
